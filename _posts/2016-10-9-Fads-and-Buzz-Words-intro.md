**Introduction**

Fads.  We are all familiar with how they work. A particular technique, language, framework, or whatever becomes popular. It is popular for some good reason.  It addresses a common problem so well that those who deal with it daily see the benefit immediately.  They speak with such enthusiasm that others, who don't face the problem every day, start talking about the new fad because they are swept up by the charisma of the early adopters.  Now phrase is thrown into every conversation, and spoken about as though everyone already knows what that phrase means and why it is so great. It has become a bona fide fad. Everyone talks about it as though it is the holy grail, and you feel like an idiot for not understanding what the big deal is.

It's even worse than this.  If you have enough self-confidence to admit that you don't see the benefit of the new fad as clearly as the person introducing it to you, you'll often get some explanation of its benefit that is abstract, clear, and convincing. It's easy to get caught up in this explanation, often conveyed with enthusiasm.  But!  When you're talking without code to reference the explanation is so abstract that you don't see the trade off.  'Of <em>course</em>,' we all think, 'Why would anyone <em>ever</em> mutate data?'). We also understand the high level explanation of the concept but, without code, pesky implementation details are lost.

In this series, I aim to explain these fads as I come across them and come to understand them.  Each post will follow the same format.

**1) Name and Explain the Fad**

I'll try to give some contrived code examples and a high level overview--the kind of thing that gets said enthusiastically over beer.

**2) Display Code that does not use the Fad, but Could.**

I'll do my best to use examples from my own code here--something that isn't contrived.

**3) Explain why this is Irritating / the Problem the Fad Claims to Solve**

I'll give a real-world explanation of how the example code led to the very problems that the fad is supposed to fix.

**4) Display Code that does use the Fad**

Here I'll give a code example that's been fixed.

**5) Explain Benefits and Trade-Offs.**

I'll try to explain the trade-offs as best I can in this section.  It's rarely the case that code which fails to employ the fad is written by some idiot who has no idea what they are doing.  Usually there is some reason not to employ the technique, and I'd like to give a fair shake to that reasoning.  Too often in this community we feel compelled to snark at other people for not having already had the thoughts we've had.  I found this behavior deplorable in academia, but there are institutional barriers that prevent changing that aspect of the culture there.  I haven't seen those barriers in tech.
