One nice way to begin to think about programming languages is to port over
categories from natural languages.  For example, I'll often tell people that
objects are nouns and functions are verbs.  As with any translation, this isn't quite
accurate, but it can help beginners wrap their heads things.

So, when a function lives within an object, it is no longer called a function.  It is called a method.
Why?

I can't tell you the original answer.  But, here is an answer that satisfies me (and helps me remember).

Suppose I have a Chair class.

````ruby
class Chair
  def initialize(style, status, working_legs=4)
    @style = style
    @status = status
    @working_legs = working_legs
  end

  def am_i_broken?
    @status == "broken"
  end

  
end
````
