I'll be happy to fill this out eventually.  But, longs story short:

I am a developer by heart and now by trade.  I earned my PhD in philosophy
late 2012 and was lucky enough to get a post-doc that turned into an assistant
professorship at a bioethics center at Stony Brook University.  Throughout my
time in the academic world I always kept one foot in the tech field.  I
made and maintained sites for some fine arts friends, went to BetaNYC civic-hacker
meetups, had a desk at Kitchen Table Coders, and spent a good bit of time among tech folk.
After one particularly enjoyable project came to a close (a twilio-integrated web-app
for administering surveys that compared different methods for measuring affect) I
realized that I genuinely enjoy working with technology and code.  I also felt,
more often than not, that there was more good to be done in tech than in the academic world.
