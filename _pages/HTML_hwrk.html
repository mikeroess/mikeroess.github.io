    <h2>Descriptions</h2>
    <p>Hey Friends.  I value delicious breakfast.  I also value time.  These are
      often but not always difficult values to reconcile.  I have found one great
      way, though.  That is with this Fast and Delicious Egg Breakfast.   What is it?
      It's just two slices of toast, some cheese, salsa, and an egg each.  It takes less
      then 10 minutes to make if you do everything right, it tastes great, and cleanup
      is only a few minutes.  The only cooking involved is frying an egg, so read all about that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fried_egg">
      here</a>.  Wikipedia has a shocking amount of
      information in the fried egg article.  Looks like some fool even took a 'foodie picture' of
      something like this: <img src="http://thebuzzmagazines.com/sites/default/files/recipes/2016/06/salsa%20and%20egg%20toast%20resized.jpg">

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Turn the high heat up on an oiled pan.</li>
        Pro Tip--Start this before you get the ingredients to save time!
      <li>Put the bread in the toaster and start that cooking on the side.</li>
      <li>Crack two eggs into the pan as soon as you can either smell or hear the oil.</li>
      <li>While those whites get solid, take your now toasted bread out.  Add a dollop of salsa and a slice of cheese per piece.</li>
          Pro Tip--Put the cheese on the bottom.  The warm toast will melt it and, through it, warm the salsa.  The egg on top will also warm the salsa.
      <li>Flip the eggs. Get rid of gross uncooked whites.</li>
      <li>Put everything but the pan and the plate away while those whites get cooked.</li>
        Don't worry, you'll still get runny yolks.  That's why we heated the pan to high.
      <li>Place eggs on toast with a 1:1 ratio.</li>
      <li>Eat while hot, savor, enjoy.  You are a human and your life has value.</li>
      <li>Clean up!  Don't be a slob!</li>
    </ol>
